# Welcome back!

You just completed your forth week and should now have two homework assignments under your belt. And you should now be a pro at testing your code, and submitting your homework via repl.it. Great job!

This week, we are going to learn to decode secret messages in Python through an exercise we call "jump the five"! We will use a Python dictionary, to change a collection of numbers to other numbers based on an 'encoding table'. After we finish, you will be able to use dictionaries for just about any purpose.  

Dictionaries are another great data structure in Python. Theyâ€™re similar to a list in that they can be used to organize data into collections. But, data in a dictionary isn't accessed based on its position. Instead, data in a dictionary is organized into key value pairs, where you use the key to access the corresponding value. A dictionary key can be any data type, like a string, integer, float, or even tuples. Dictionaries are also mutable, meaning they can be modified by adding, removing, and replacing elements in a dictionary, similar to lists. 

Next, we will use for loops to iterate through charaters in a string. We will change a secret phone number to a encoded phone number, by substituting the numbers to their encoded value. While we do this, we will skip over anything that is not a number and just print that value. This exercise will show you how to create a dictionary with numbers, retrieve the encoded values from the dictionary based on a key, and print a new string with the substituted numbers.

Lastly, we will learn how to create lists using a for loop with list comprehension. List comprehension is a streamlined way to create a new list from a sequence or a range in a single line. For example, we could iterate over a range of numbers from 1 to 10, and multiply each element in the range by 3 to get multiples of 3.

You will put everything you've learned to the test in the graded homework assignment and for the practice quiz. In this week's homework you will write a program to sing the solfege song from the sound of music. You will add the the syllables in the song "Do, Re, Me, Fa, Sol, La, Ti" as keys in the dictionary, and associate their key  "Do", with their value "A deer, a female deer".

 When you are ready, and all of the tests pass, submit your homework in repl.it by "submitting" your code. Remember that your code should be placed in the 03_solfege directory in repl.it. Be sure to reach out over slack if you need any help at all, or attend office hours. I'll catch up with you there.
